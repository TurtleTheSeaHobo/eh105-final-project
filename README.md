# EH105 Final Project
It's my final project for EH105---a standard on the design and construction of
spacecraft-borne artifacts like those aboard *Pioneer 10*, *Pioneer 11*,
*Voyager 1*, and *Voyager 2*.

# Reading
If you're viewing this on GitHub, you can just click on
[final\_project\_std.pdf](https://github.com/TurtleTheSeaHobo/eh105-final-project/blob/main/final_project_std.pdf)
to view the latest PDF render of the document. You can also download the PDF
from that page if you need to do so.

# Building
Build instructions here are provided for Linux-based systems. If you're handy,
you can probably get it to work anywhere else where you can compile LaTeX.

To build the document, make sure you have the following installed:
- git
- make
- pdflatex

First, clone and enter the repository on your machine:

`$ git clone https://github.com/TurtleTheSeaHobo/eh105-final-project.git`  
`$ cd eh105-final-project`

Then build the document using the Makefile:

`$ make`

You now have a PDF which, unless you changed anything, is identical to the one
you already downloaded.
